# This is a single-line comment

# Define a function
def greet(name):
    # Print a greeting
    print("Hello " + name + "!")

# Call the function
greet("Yatharth")


'''
In this example:

def is a keyword used to define a function.
greet is an identifier for the function name.
name is an identifier for the function parameter.
print is a function used to output text.
"Hello, " + name + "!" is an expression that concatenates strings.
The # symbol denotes a comment.

"""
In programming, syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that 
are considered to be correctly structured programs or expressions in a language. 
Syntax determines how the various symbols, keywords, and operators of the language must be arranged and used to form valid statements or expressions.

Here are a few key points about syntax in programming:

Keywords: Reserved words that have a specific meaning in the language and cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names). 
Examples include if, else, while, for, etc.
Operators: Symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Examples include +, -, *, /, =, ==, etc.
Punctuation: Characters that organize code and separate statements. Examples include ;, ,, (), {}, [].
Identifiers: Names given to variables, functions, classes, etc., by the programmer.
Data types: Type of data present inside a variable.
Statements: Individual instructions written in a program. For example, x = 5 is an assignment statement.
Expressions: Combinations of variables, operators, and values that produce a result. For example, 3 + 4 is an expression.
Structure: The overall organization of code, such as how functions, loops, and conditionals are used.

Different programming languages have different syntax rules.
Syntax errors occur when the code violates these rules, making it impossible for the compiler or interpreter to understand the code.
