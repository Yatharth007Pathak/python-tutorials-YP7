"""
Python modules are files containing Python code (such as functions, classes, or variables) that we can import and use in other Python programs.
Modules help organize and reuse code, making programs easier to manage and maintain. 
Modules help keep our code modular, organized, and reusable.

Key Points:
Single File: A module is typically a single Python file with a .py extension. 
For example, a file named math_utils.py could be a module containing math-related functions.

Importing Modules: To use a module in another Python script, we use the import statement.

After importing, we can use the functions or classes defined in the module.

Standard Library Modules: Python comes with a rich standard library that includes modules for various tasks, 
like math for mathematical operations, os for interacting with the operating system, and datetime for handling dates and times.

Third-Party Modules: We can also install third-party modules using tools like pip. 
For example, requests is a popular module for making HTTP requests.

Custom Modules: We can create our own modules by writing Python code in a .py file.


Python modules offer several advantages that make programming more efficient, organized, and manageable. Here are some key benefits:

1. Code Reusability
Reuse Functions Across Projects: Once we write a function or class in a module, we can reuse it in multiple projects without rewriting the code.
Shareable Code: Modules can be shared across different projects or with other developers, making collaboration easier.

2. Organization
Logical Grouping: Modules allow us to group related functions, classes,and variables into a single file, making the codebase easier to navigate.
Separation of Concerns: By dividing functionality into different modules,
each module can focus on a specific aspect of your application, improving maintainability.

3. Namespace Management
Avoid Name Conflicts: Modules help manage namespaces, reducing the risk of name collisions between variables, 
functions, or classes in different parts of the program.

4. Simplified Maintenance
Ease of Updates: When we need to update or fix a function, 
we only have to do it in one place—the module—rather than searching through the entire codebase.
Version Control: Modules can be versioned separately, allowing you to track changes and updates more efficiently.

5. Encapsulation
Hide Implementation Details: Modules allow you to hide the internal implementation of functions and classes, 
exposing only the necessary interfaces. This promotes cleaner and more secure code.

6. Standard Library and Third-Party Modules
Access to Pre-built Functionality: Python's standard library provides a wide range of modules for common tasks, saving time and effort. 
Third-party modules extend this functionality even further.
Community Support: Many third-party modules are well-documented and supported by the Python community, 
making it easier to implement complex features.

7. Performance
Load on Demand: Python only loads modules when they are first imported, 
which can improve the initial loading time of a program and reduce memory usage.

8. Improved Testing and Debugging
Isolated Testing: By separating code into modules, we can test each module independently, making debugging easier.
Unit Testing: Modules allow for the creation of specific test cases for individual functions or classes, ensuring they work as expected.

9. Modularity
Plug-and-Play: Modules allow us to add or remove functionality from your application easily without affecting the rest of the codebase.
Scalability: As our project grows, we can continue to add more modules without making the codebase unmanageable.

# Creating our own module

'''
if you have a file named ld.py:
# ld.py
def loop_function():
    for i in range(5):
        print("This is loop iteration:", i)

We can import and use it in another script:
'''

import ld
ld.loop_function()

'''
Breakdown:

Import Statement: import ld imports the ah module.
Function Call: ld.loop_function() calls the loop_function defined in ld.py, which then executes the loop inside the function.
