"""
Python libraries are collections of pre-written code that provide functionality for various tasks, so we don't have to write code from scratch.
They make it easier to develop applications by offering ready-made functions, classes, and methods. 


Python libraries offer several advantages that make them highly beneficial for developers. Here are some key advantages:

Code Reusability: Python libraries contain pre-written code, allowing us to reuse functions, classes, and methods. 
This saves time and effort by eliminating the need to write code from scratch.

Simplified Development: Libraries provide easy-to-use interfaces and functions that abstract complex processes, making development simpler. 
For example, data analysis tasks that would require many lines of code can be accomplished 
with just a few lines using libraries like Pandas or NumPy.

Community Support: Many Python libraries are open-source and have large communities of developers who contribute to their 
improvement and maintenance, This ensures that libraries are up-to-date, secure, and feature-rich.

Wide Range of Applications: There are Python libraries available for almost every domain, including web development, data science, 
machine learning, networking, automation, and more. This versatility allows Python to be used in diverse fields.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python libraries are usually cross-platform, meaning they can run on different operating systems like Windows, 
macOS, and Linux without modification. This makes Python a convenient choice for developing applications 
that need to be deployed across multiple environments.

Enhanced Productivity: By using libraries, developers can focus on higher-level logic and functionality rather than low-level details. 
This leads to faster development cycles and allows developers to build complex applications more efficiently.

Better Performance: Many libraries are optimized for performance, especially those dealing with computation-intensive tasks 
like NumPy for numerical operations or TensorFlow for machine learning. 
These libraries are often implemented in lower-level languages like C or C++, making them faster than pure Python implementations.

Ease of Learning and Use: Python libraries are designed to be user-friendly, with well-documented APIs and extensive resources available online. 
This makes it easier for beginners to learn and start using them quickly.

Community Contributions: The collaborative nature of the Python community ensures that the libraries are regularly updated and improved.

Ecosystem: The extensive ecosystem of Python libraries means that there is likely a library available 
for any specific need or problem we might encounter.

Scalability: Python libraries can be used to build scalable applications. 
For instance, web frameworks like Django or Flask can be used to develop scalable web applications that can handle a large number of users.

# The itertools library provides functions that create iterators for efficient looping.

import itertools

# Generate all possible combinations of a list
items = ['A', 'B', 'C']
combinations = list(itertools.combinations(items, 2))
print(f"All possible combinations: {combinations}")

# Generate all permutations of a list
permutations = list(itertools.permutations(items))
print(f"All permutations: {permutations}")
