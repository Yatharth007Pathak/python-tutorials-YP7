In Python, comments are used to explain and annotate the code, making it more readable and easier to understand. 
There are two types of comments in Python:

Single-line comments: These comments start with a hash symbol (#) and extend to the end of the line. They are used for brief explanations or notes.

Multi-line comments: Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments, but you can use triple quotes (""") 
to create a string that is not assigned to any variable. 
These are often used for documentation strings (docstrings) but can also serve as multi-line comments.

It can span multiple lines.

"""
A compiler is a special program that translates code written in one programming language (the source language) 
into another language (the target language). Typically, compilers convert high-level programming languages like C, C++, or 
Java into machine code or lower-level languages that can be executed by a computer's CPU. 

An interpreter is a program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or 
scripting language without requiring them to be compiled into machine code.

An assembler is a specialized program that translates assembly language, 
which is a low-level programming language closely related to machine language, into machine code. 
Machine code is a set of binary instructions that a computer's central processing unit (CPU) can execute directly.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. 
Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation.
Python was invented by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer
The officialdate of birth of python is 20th feb 1991
Python is recommended as first programming language for beginners
The name python was selected from a Tv show "the complete monty python's circus"

Here are some key features of Python:

Simple and Readable Syntax: Python's syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, 
making it a great language for beginners and experienced developers alike.
Freeware and open source: Python software can be used without any licence and it is freeware.
Its source code is open, so that we can customize based on our requirement.
Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier and allows for interactive testing.
Dynamically Typed: Variables in Python do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space.
Both Procedure oriented and Object oriented: Python language supports both procedure oriented (like C, pascal etc)
and object oriented (like C++, java) features. Hence we can get benefits of both security and reusability.
The interpreter automatically identifies the type of the variable based on the value assigned.
Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that includes modules and packages for a 
wide range of tasks, from web development to data manipulation.
Cross-Platform: Python is available on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, which makes it highly versatile.
Community and Ecosystem: Python has a large and active community, which contributes to a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries 
and frameworks, such as Django for web development, Pandas for data analysis, and TensorFlow for machine learning.

Python is often used in various domains:

Web Development: Frameworks like Django, Flask, and Pyramid are used to build web applications.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, 
and TensorFlow are used for data analysis and building machine learning models.
Automation and Scripting: Python is frequently used for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
Scientific Computing: Libraries like SciPy and Matplotlib are used for scientific research and visualization.
Game Development: Libraries like Pygame are used for creating simple games.
Python's versatility and ease of use have made it one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Limitations of Python:
Not used for mobile applications.

Flavors of python:
CPython: It is the standard flavour of python. It can be used to work with C language applications
Jython: It is for java applications. it can run on JVM.
IronPython: IT is for C#.Net platform
RubyPython: It id fo Ruby platforms
AnacondaPython: It is specifically designed fo handling large volume of data processing
