To shut down a laptop using Python, we can utilize the os module to execute system-specific commands.
Note that this requires administrative privileges and may differ based on the operating system. 
Here's how you can do it for different operating systems
'''

import os

def shutdown_windows():
    os.system('shutdown /s /t 0')

# Call the function to shut down the laptop
shutdown_windows()

'''
/s: Specifies that the system is to shut down.
/t 0: Specifies a delay of 0 seconds before the shutdown.
'''

Note on Permissions
Windows: Administrative privileges are not typically required for the shutdown command, 
but it might be if we're running the script in a restricted environment.
Linux/macOS: The sudo command is used to execute the shutdown command with root privileges. 
We might need to enter your password or configure sudo to allow running the shutdown command without a password prompt.

Caution
Data Loss: Running these commands will immediately shut down the laptop. Ensure that any unsaved work is saved before executing the script.
Permissions: Ensure that we have the necessary permissions to shut down the computer, especially if running on a network or managed environment.
